        <h2>Experince</h2>

        <h3>Transit Beat Reporter, News Desk</h3>
        <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
        <h5>Jan. 2025 - Present</h5>
        <p>
            As a transit beat reporter I cover on campus construction projects, transportation, and micromobility. I
            conduct interviews and write one news story a week to inform campus community members and College Park
            residents about changes to construction and transit in the area.
        </p>

        <h3>Multimedia Editor, Digital News</h3>
        <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>
        <h5>Jan. 2025 – Present</h5>
        <p>
            I manage staff writers and collaborate with other leadership staff to publish stories. I edit staff writers’
            stories, checking for factual, AP style and grammatical errors and publish stories on WordPress to publish
            stories.
        </p>

        <h3>Staff Photographer, Photo Desk</h3>
        <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
        <h5>Jan. 2024 – Dec. 2025</h5>
        <p>
            I photographed the University of Maryland and the City of College Park’s news and events. I wrote AP style
            captions for photographs and edited photos in Adobe Lightroom. I also collaborated with staff writers and
            the engagement team to create social media videos and photos.
        </p>

        <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
        <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>
        <h5>Aug. 2025 – Jan. 2025</h5>
        <p>
            I interviewed students, faculty, and staff and wrote stories about news and events on the University of
            Maryland’s campus. I also collaborated with photographers and social media staff members.
        </p>

        <h3>Intern, Producing</h3>
        <h4>CBS 17 News</h4>
        <h5>June 2025 – Aug. 2025</h5>
        <p>
            I shadowed news producers, anchors, reporters, and assignment desk staff members to learn about their
            processes. I learned how to stack, write, and booth a live broadcast using ENPS. I wrote for air story
            teases and assisted in shooting a station promotional video.
